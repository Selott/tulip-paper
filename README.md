# Tulip

The **Totally Useful** and **Levelheaded Information Processor**, or **TULIP** in short, is a custom-written logger used by any of my projects running on the PaperSpigot API. Usage of the Logger at this state of development is highly discouraged, as optimization and distinct features are reserved for later versions.
